The rendering mode. Can be either:
* markdown to render a document as plain Markdown, just like README files are rendered. 
* gfm to render a document as user-content, e.g. like user comments or issues are rendered. In GFM mode, hard line breaks are always taken into account, and issue and user mentions are linked accordingly.
Default: markdown
