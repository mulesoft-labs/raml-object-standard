        Upload a release asset
        This is a unique endpoint. The request domain changes from "api.github.com" to "uploads.github.com". You need to use an HTTP client which supports SNI to make calls to this endpoint.
        The asset data is expected in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. Everything else about the endpoint is the same. Pass your authentication exactly the same as the rest of the API.
      headers: 
        Content-Type:
